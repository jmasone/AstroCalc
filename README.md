# AstroCalc
Inspired by the book "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator" by Peter Duffett-Smith

This project will contain various classes that encapsulate the computations derived from the book.  For example, one class will be called JulianDate which encapsulates the decimal value of Julian date and provides various methods to get/set the Julian date based on calendar date values (MM, DD, YYYY) and time values (HH, MM, SS).  The main goal is to provide a set of common classes (i.e. an astronomy SDK) to assist anyone writing an astronomy-based application.
