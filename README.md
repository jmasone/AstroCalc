# AstroCalc
Inspired by the book "Practical Astronomy with your Calculator" by Peter Duffett-Smith

This project will contain various Java classes that encapsulate the computations derived from the book.  For example, one class will be called JulianDate which encapsulates the decimal value of Julian date and provides various methods to get/set the Julian date based on various calendar date and time input types.  The main goal is to provide a set of common Java classes (i.e. an astronomy SDK) to assist anyone writing an astronomy-based Java application.
